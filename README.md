**Question 1:**

Swing framework is a toolkit made for Java based applications that allows you to build graphical user interfaces. It lets you create interactive programs by adding features such as buttons, tables, labels, and checkboxes. It is also a lightweight toolkit since all of its components are entirely written in Java, allowing it to render faster than heavyweight toolkits. Swing can also be used across different hardware and operating systems, and supports the MVC design pattern.

<br>**Question 2:**

This example implements the MVC pattern with the Model, View, and Controller classes. The Model class is simply used to store first and last name data. The View class is where all of the Swing UI components are handled. This is where information is displayed to the user. Finally, the Controller class connects the Model and View. It initializes the View data, then listens for user actions in the UI. Whenever the user saves the names, the Controller updates the Model, and whenever the user interacts with the UI, the Controller updates the View. MySwingMVCApp is the class that ties all the components together by creating the Model, View, Controller, and launching the application. This differs from the conventional MVC pattern because normally, the MVC pattern uses an observer design. Typically, View would directly observe the Model and automatically update whenever the data from the Model changes. Additionally, in the typical MVC pattern, the Controller just focuses on handling input.
